# Advent of Code 2017

My solutions to [these awesome puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2017). To run the code, you need [Node v6+](https://nodejs.org). 

In the root directory, first install NPM packages. 
```sh
$ npm install
```
Then open task's directory and run `task.js`.
```sh
$ cd 1
$ node task.js
```


*DISCLAIMER: The code is mostly optimized for speed and readability/clarity so it is more verbose than it could be. But sometimes readability is sacrificed for shortness too. There is no ideal solution for any of the tasks, so I tried to find a good balance between all the criteria.*
